# Augmented-Reality-Food-Menu
This` is a simple marker-based Augmented reality application called the AR Food Menu. This application was made to enhance the look of a simple dinner menu, with the first course, main meal, dessert, and drinks.  The markers used in this application were created by me and uploaded through vuforia. This project was created using Vuforia and Unity3D game engine.
